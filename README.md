# GlyphShell

**GlyphShell** is a minimalist, open-source Tauri app that wraps the ChatGPT web UI into a desktop vessel. 
It is designed to be a clean base for building more complex AI interaction layers (memory, persona, prompts, etc).

## Features
- Lightweight Tauri-based app (~3MB)
- Full native wrapper for https://chatgpt.com

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/glyph-shell.git
cd glyph-shell
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

The rituals are yours to conjure.
